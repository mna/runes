## Usage

```
usage: runes [-h] [-json] [CODEPT ...] [START-END ...] [- STRING ...]

The runes command prints information about Unicode code points. Specific code
points can be requested as arguments, and ranges of code points are supported
(e.g. 0x17-0x60). Code points starting with '0x' or 'u+' are considered in
hexadecimal (the 'x' and 'u' are case insensitive), otherwise the number is
treated as decimal.

A single dash argument '-' can be used so that subsequent arguments are treated
as strings for which each rune will be printed.

The output follows the order of runes as specified on the command-line,
the same rune will be printed multiple times if it is specified or included
in multiple arguments.

Flags:
  -h,-help           Display this message.
  -json              Output JSON data.
  -all               Print all Unicode code points.

Examples:
    runes -all
    runes -json 0x2318 40-60
    runes u+1f970 0X55-0XA0 - "Some string"
```
